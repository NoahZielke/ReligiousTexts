                <hr>
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In very ancient times, there existed a <i>husaa</i> named Yanamca Tutanamca. After these <i>huacas</i>, there was another <i>huaca</i> named Huallallo Carhuincho. This <i>huaca</i> prevailed. Once he had power, he commanded that man should only have two children. One of them he would devour, and the other—the one the parents chose out of love—he allowed to live. And from then on, when people died, they would revive after five days, and likewise, the crops would mature five days after being sown. These towns, the towns throughout this region, had many <i>yuncas</i> (warm coastal valleys). That is why they increased so much, and because they multiplied in this way, they lived miserably—even in the cliffs, they made small fields on the small plateaus of the cliffs, digging and breaking the soil. Even now, in all places, one can still see the lands they sowed, some small, some large. And in those times, the birds were very beautiful—the <i>huritu</i> and the <i>caqui</i>, all yellow, or each one red—all of them.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Later, another <i>hise</i> appeared who bore the name Pariacaca. Then he cast out the men from all over. Now we are going to speak about those later events and Pariacaca himself. At that time, there was a <i>huaca</i> named Cuniraya—he existed then. But we do not know well whether Cuniraya came before or after Pariacaca, or whether Cuniraya existed at the same time as Viracocha, the creator of man; because people used to pray in this way: “Cuniraya Viracocha, maker of man, maker of the world, you have everything that can be had, the fields are yours, man is yours; I [belong to you].” And when they had to begin a difficult task, they worshiped him by throwing coca leaves to the ground, saying: “May he remember this, may Cuniraya Viracocha divine it.” And even though they could not see Viracocha, the very ancient people would speak to him and worship him. And even more so did the master weavers, who had such difficult work—they would worship and cry out. For this reason, we must write about the things that happened before he (<i>Cuniraya</i>) existed, along with the events of <i>Pariacaca</i>.
                </p>
                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    This <i>Cuniraya Viracocha</i>, in the most ancient times, walked around taking the appearance of a very poor man; his <i>yacolla</i> (mantle) and his <i>cusma</i> (tunic) were in tatters. Some, who didn’t know him, would murmur when they saw him: “miserable louse-ridden man,” they said. This man had power over all the towns. Just by speaking, he could get beautifully finished terraces built and supported by walls. He also taught how to make irrigation canals by throwing into the mud the flower of a cane called <i>pupuna</i>; he taught that they should build them from the source (the beginning). And in this way, doing one thing and another, he went around humbling the <i>huacas</i> of certain towns with his wisdom.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    And so, at that time, there was a <i>huaca</i> named <i>Cavillaca</i>. She was a virgin, always had been. And because she was beautiful, the <i>huacas</i>—now one, now another, all of them—said, “I’m going to sleep with her,” and sought her, desired her. But none achieved what they intended. Then, without allowing any man to so much as cross legs with her, one day she sat down to weave at the foot of a <i>lúcuma</i> tree. At that moment, <i>Cuniraya</i>, being wise, turned into a bird and climbed the tree. Once on a branch, he took a fruit, placed his male seed inside it, and made the fruit fall in front of the woman. She, very happy, swallowed the seed. And in that way, she became pregnant, without having had contact with any man. Nine months later, like any woman, she gave birth to a girl. For a year, she nursed the child at her breast. “Whose daughter might she be?” she wondered. And when the girl turned exactly one year old and was already crawling on all fours, the mother summoned the <i>huacas</i> from all over. She wanted them to recognize her daughter. The <i>huacas</i>, upon hearing the news, dressed in their finest garments. “She will choose me, she will choose me,” they said, and came in response to <i>Cavillaca</i>’s call.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The gathering was held in <i>Anchicocha</i>, where the woman lived. And there, when all the sacred <i>huacas</i> from every region were seated, the woman said to them: “Look, men, powerful lords, recognize this child. Which of you planted your seed in me?” And she asked each one, privately: “Was it you? Was it you?” she kept asking. And none of them answered, “She is mine.” And so, because <i>Cuniraya Viracocha</i>, whom we have spoken of, was sitting humbly, appearing as a very poor man, the woman didn’t question him. “He cannot be the father of my child,” she said, disgusted by that ragged man, and did not ask him—because this <i>Cuniraya</i> was surrounded by men dressed beautifully. And as no one admitted, “She is my daughter,” the woman spoke to the girl: “Go yourself and recognize your father,” and to the <i>huacas</i> she said: “If one of you is the father, she will try to climb into his arms.” Then, the child began crawling on all fours to where the ragged man was. Along the way, she did not attempt to climb onto any of those present; but as soon as she reached the poor man, very happily and immediately, she clung to his legs. When the mother saw this, she was enraged: “How disgusting! Did I really bear the child of such a miserable man?” she exclaimed, lifting her daughter and running toward the sea. Seeing this, <i>Cuniraya Viracocha</i> said, “Now she must love me,” and dressing himself in his golden garments, he frightened all the <i>huacas</i>; and while they stood there, so frightened, he began to drive them away, saying: “Sister <i>Cavillaca</i>, look this way and behold me; now I am very handsome.” And making his garment flash with light, he stood proudly erect. But she didn’t even turn her eyes toward the place where <i>Cuniraya</i> was; she kept fleeing toward the sea. “Because I bore the filthy child of a despicable man, I will disappear,” she said, and saying that, she threw herself into the water. And there, even today, in that deep sea of <i>Pachacamac</i>, two stone figures in human shape can clearly be seen living there. As soon as they fell into the water, both (mother and daughter) turned into stone.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Then <i>Cuniraya Viracocha</i> said: “My sister must see me, she must appear,” and saying this, calling and crying out, he left the place (<i>Anchicocha</i>). And he encountered an ancient condor. He asked the condor: “Brother, where did you see her, that woman?” “Very near here,” the condor replied, “you shall find her.” And <i>Cuniraya</i> said to him: “You shall live a long life. When wild animals die—whether <i>huanaco</i>, <i>vicuña</i>, or any other—you will eat their flesh. And if someone kills you, that person, whoever they are, shall also die.” Thus he said.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Then he met the skunk. And when he asked, “Brother, where did you see her, that woman?” the skunk replied, “You will never find her again; she has gone too far.” “For giving me that news, you shall never walk during the day again, never, for men will hate you; and so, hated and stinking, you will wander only at night and suffer in disgrace,” <i>Cuniraya</i> said to him. A little later he met the puma. The puma told <i>Cuniraya</i>: “She is very near, you will catch up to her.” <i>Cuniraya</i> replied: “You shall be greatly loved; you shall eat the llamas of guilty men. And if you are killed, men will place your head upon their own during grand festivals, and they will make you sing; every year they will sacrifice a llama, take you outside, and make you sing.” Then he met a fox, and the fox said: “She is already very far away; you will not find her.” <i>Cuniraya</i> replied: “You, even when you walk far from men—who shall hate you—they will pursue you; they will say: ‘that miserable fox,’ and they will not be satisfied with killing you; for their amusement, they will trample your hide, they will mistreat it.”
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Later, he met a hawk; the hawk said to him: “She is very near, you shall find her,” and <i>Cuniraya</i> replied: “You shall be very happy; you shall feast on hummingbirds and later eat birds of all kinds. And if you die, or someone kills you, men will offer you with a llama; and when they sing and dance, they will place you upon their heads, and there, beautifully, you shall remain.”
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Then he met a little parrot; and the parrot said: “She has already crossed a great distance; you will not find her.” <i>Cuniraya</i> replied: “You will always go about screaming too much; when you say, ‘I will destroy your food,’ men—who will hate you—will discover you by your cries and will scare you away; you will live in suffering.”
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    And so, to anyone who gave him good news, <i>Cuniraya</i> granted gifts, and continued on his way. But to anyone who discouraged him with bad news, he cursed them and kept walking. [Thus he reached the shore of the sea. As soon as he arrived, he entered the water and made it swell and rise. And from that event, people today say that he turned it into a <i>castilla</i> (possibly “fortress” or “region”); “the ancient world also goes to another world,” they say.]
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    And he returned, toward <i>Pachacamac</i>, and there he came to the place where two young daughters of <i>Pachacamac</i> lived. The young girls were guarded by a serpent. Shortly before <i>Cuniraya</i> arrived, the mother of the two girls had gone to visit <i>Cavillaca</i> at the bottom of the sea where she had thrown herself; the name of this woman was <i>Hurpayhuachac</i>. While the woman was away, <i>Cuniraya Viracocha</i> made the elder girl fall asleep, and when he attempted to lie with the younger sister, she turned into a dove and flew away. And that is why the mother was later called: “the one who gives birth to doves.”
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    At that time, they say, not a single fish existed in the sea. Only the woman they called “The one who gives birth to doves” raised (fish) in a small pool she had in her home. And <i>Cuniraya</i>, very angry: “Why does this woman visit <i>Cavillaca</i> in the depths of the water?” he said, and threw all the belongings of <i>Urpayhuachac</i> into the great sea. And only from then on did fish grow and multiply in the great lake. Then that one, named <i>Cuniraya</i>, wandered along the shore of the great lake; and the woman <i>Urpayhuachac</i>, upon hearing how her daughters had slept, furiously chased after <i>Cuniraya</i>. And as she pursued him, calling him—“Oh!”—she stopped. Then she spoke to him: “I am only going to delouse you.” And she began to delouse him. And when she had finished, in that very place, she made a great cliff rise and thought: “I will make <i>Cuniraya</i> fall there.” But in his wisdom, he sensed the woman’s plan. “I just need to urinate a little, sister,” he said, and he left—he came to these lands and stayed in them, in their surroundings or nearby, for a long time, deceiving men and towns.
                </p>
                <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The story they tell goes as follows: In ancient times, this world was in danger of disappearing. A male <i>llama</i> that grazed on a mountain with excellent grass knew that the Mother Lake (the sea) had wanted (and decided) to overflow, to fall like a waterfall. This <i>llama</i> became sorrowful; it complained, crying “in, in,” and would not eat. The <i>llama</i>’s owner, very angry, struck it with a corn cob husk: “Eat, dog,” he said, “you’re resting on the best grass.” Then the <i>llama</i>, speaking as if it were a man, said to him: “Take careful note and remember what I’m going to tell you: now, in five days’ time, the great lake will arrive, and the whole world will be destroyed,” he said, speaking. And the owner was terrified; he believed him. “Let’s go anywhere to escape. We’re going to the mountain <i>Huilicacoto</i>, there we will be saved; bring food for five days,” he commanded, he said. And so, from that moment, the man began to walk, bringing his family and the <i>llama</i>. When he was about to reach the hill of <i>Huillcacoto</i>, he found that all the animals were gathered there: the puma, the fox, the <i>huanaco</i>, the condor, all species of animals. And just as the man arrived, the water began to fall in waterfalls; then, packed tightly together, men and animals from all over stayed on the hill of <i>Huillcacoto</i>, in a small space, only at the peak, where the water could not reach. But the water managed to touch the tip of the fox’s tail and wet it; that is why it became blackened. And after five days passed, the water began to recede and dried up; and the dry land grew; the sea retreated further, and in retreating and drying up, it killed all the men. Only that one from the mountain survived, and through him people began to multiply again, and because of him, mankind exists to this day. And we now bless this story; we Christians bless that time of the flood, just as they tell it and bless the time in which they were able to save themselves, on the mountain <i>Huillcacoto</i>.
                </p>
                <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In ancient times, they say that the sun died. And, with the sun dead, there was darkness for five days. The stones, then, struck each other, one against another; from that time, the so-called <i>morteros</i> (grinding mortars), that is, the <i>muchcas</i>, and also the <i>batanes</i> (grinding stones), were formed. People began to eat using those things; the <i>llamas</i> from the hills began to follow man. And this, we Christians now bless, saying: “Perhaps the world darkened because of the death of our powerful Lord Jesus Christ.” And it is possible that it was so.
                </p>
