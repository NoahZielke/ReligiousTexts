                <hr>
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application?
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The philosopher Yu said, "They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,—are they not the root of all benevolent actions?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The philosopher Tsang said, "I daily examine myself on three points:—whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful; whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere; whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-hsia said, "If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:—although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Have no friends not equal to yourself.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The philosopher Tsang said, "Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice:—then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, "When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-kung said, "Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,—is it not different from that of other men?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The philosopher Yu said, "In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The philosopher Yu said, "When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:—such a person may be said indeed to love to learn."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-kung said, "What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?" The Master replied, "They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-kung replied, "It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'—The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men."
                </p>
                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    At thirty, I stood firm.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    At forty, I had no doubts.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, "It is not being disobedient."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, "Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,—'not being disobedient.'"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Fan Ch'ih said, "What did you mean?" The Master replied, "That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, "Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, "The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;—without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, "The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;—as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!—He is not stupid."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "See what a man does.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Mark his motives.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Examine in what things he rests.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "The accomplished scholar is not a utensil."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;—this is knowledge."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:—then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Duke Ai asked, saying, "What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?" Confucius replied, "Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, "Let him preside over them with gravity;—then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;—then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;—then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Some one addressed Confucius, saying, "Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?—'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT—making one be in the government?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage."
                </p>
                <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                      Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, "If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                      The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, "'Assisting are the princes;–the son of heaven looks profound and grave';–what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                      The Master said, "If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?"
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                      Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                      The Master said, "A great question indeed!
                      In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                      The Master said, "The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them."
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                      The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, "Can you not save him from this?" He answered, "I cannot." Confucius said, "Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?"

Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop."

                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it."

                    Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, "This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his parents?"

                    Tsze-lu said, "Does the superior man esteem valor?" The Master said, "The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit robbery."

                    Tsze-kung said, "Has the superior man his hatreds also?" The Master said, "He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted understanding."

                <p class="gen">
                    The Master then inquired, "Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?" Tsze-kung replied, "I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward."

                <p class="gen">
                    The Master said, "Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented."

"I am," replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping.

Tsze-lu said to him, "Have you seen my master, sir?" The old man replied, "Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:-who is your master?" With this, he planted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed.

If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it.

They replied, "Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do so.'" Tsze-chang observed, "This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them.

While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?"

                    Yao said, "Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end."

The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person."

                    Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce."

                    Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by being beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic without being fierce?"

                    Tsze-chang then asked, "What are meant by the four bad things?" The Master said, "To put the people to death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of a mere official."
