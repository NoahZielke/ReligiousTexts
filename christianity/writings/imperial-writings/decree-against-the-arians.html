                <p class="gen">
                    Arius, having imitated the wicked and impious, is rightly deserving of the same dishonor as they received. Just as Porphyry, the enemy of godliness, having composed certain unlawful writings against the holy religion, received his due reward - namely, to become a disgrace to posterity and to be filled with the greatest heretical error, while his impious books were destroyed - so it now seems fitting that Arius and those of like mind with Arius should be called Porphyrians, in order that, since they imitate his ways, they might also bear his name.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    In addition to this, if any writing composed by Arius should be found, it shall be handed over to the flames, so that not only may his evil teaching be obliterated, but no memory of him at all may remain. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    I further declare this: if anyone is discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and does not immediately bring it forward and burn it with fire, the penalty for that person shall be death. For as soon as they are caught in this matter, they shall suffer capital punishment.
                </p>

                    And by His own hand, God will protect you, beloved brethren.

                <h3 class="pb-2">The Decree According to Socrates Scholasticus</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to the bishops and people. Since Arius has imitated wicked and impious persons, it is just that he should undergo the like ignominy. Wherefore as Porphyry, that enemy of piety, for having composed licentious treatises against religion, found a suitable recompense, and such as thenceforth branded him with infamy, overwhelming him with deserved reproach, his impious writings also having been destroyed; so now it seems fit both that Arius and such as hold his sentiments should be denominated Porphyrians, that they may take their appellation from those whose conduct they have imitated.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    And in addition to this, if any treatise composed by Arius should be discovered, let it be consigned to the flames, in order that not only his depraved doctrine may be suppressed, but also that no memorial of him may be by any means left. This therefore I decree, that if any one shall be detected in concealing a book compiled by Arius, and shall not instantly bring it forward and burn it, the penalty for this offense shall be death; for immediately after conviction the criminal shall suffer capital punishment. May God preserve you!
